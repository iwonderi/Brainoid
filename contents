The Brainoid can be divided into several modules, each corresponds to
certain stage of dealing with BCI signals. The home folder of Brainoid
contains:

    +prep - This folder is a package that contains codes for
            pre-processing, like normalize, down-sampling or
            windsorize. You can write an apply function under this
            folder to evoke these procedrues.

     +res - This folder is the resouces package. In other words, all
     	    the load-pathes, electrodes definition and other meta
     	    information should be stored here. Remeber to separate
     	    your codes and data as much as you can. You can use a csv
     	    (Comma-Separated Vaules) file to store your data, and use
     	    csvread() function to load the values in your code.

  +models - This folder is where your algorithms stays. You can create
  	    a package for an individual algorithm, like +models/+blda
  	    for Bayesian Linear Discriminant analysis, or +models/+hmm
  	    for Hidden Markov Models. Typically, you can add apply and
  	    eval function for your models, just like the examples
  	    under +modes/blda.

  +output - This folder is a storage for output codes, like reshaping
  	    the output matrices, or drawing figures. You can also put
  	    the figures and other kinds of output files under this
  	    directory.

    +test - This package is for unit testing. For developing softwares
    	    that is more agile and more durable, Test-Driven
    	    Developing (TDD) is a good helper. Write your test cases
    	    even before writting your codes, that will help you
    	    forming a more solid image of what you are building. Then
    	    write codes to pass the tests. An example of unit test is
    	    already given, which to be found under +test/+crossval/,
    	    just try it out.
