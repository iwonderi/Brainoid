Brainoid
========

Brainoid is an Octave/Matlab framework for analysing BCI data. It is
developed in order to help you get out from those erroneous, repeating
work.


# Objectives

The major objective of Brainoid is to bring you a handy set of
softwares to make it easier to build a BCI system, either online or
offline. We decided to achive this goal by modularization, which means
every part of signal processing, for example preprocessing, modeling
and postprocessing. Each part, aka. module, can be seperated into
several smaller parts, called sub-modules, like normalization, or
windsorking in preprocessing.

We decided to provide Brainoid as a framework. In other words, you can
repalca those pre-defined modules to achive your specification. By
introducing the concept of modules, you can write codes that is
reusable and more readable, which you will benefit from on the long
run.

Another tool we introduced is Test-Driven Development (TDD). The
concept is write tests, then try to write codes to pass these
tests. TDD will help you write maintainable modules.
